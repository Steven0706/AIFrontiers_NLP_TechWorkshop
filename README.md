These files would be used as part of tech workshop on NLP.

If you are an attendee of the workshop, here is what you 
need to do before you come for the session: 
(a) Download all the files in this repository into a separate directory 
(b) If you do not have python installed in your machine, download any 
free online python IDE. I have used PyCharm Community edition (2016.3). 
(c) Please download nltk and download all the text corpora available 
at http://www.nltk.org/ (i.e. run the following two commands using a 
ipyhon notebook: (a) import nltk (b) nltk.download() ) 
(d) Also install the following packages from online free resources: 
In my experience anaconda (https://www.continuum.io/downloads) is a 
good package manager that MAY serve all your needs. Check that 
you have installed the packages correctly: 
Numpy, Pandas, Tensorflow, Keras
